"profile.explanation.feedback" = "You can give feedback to the other users every time you have offered something to them or requested something from them. With the feedback you can express whether the actions of the other party were as expected. Other users can see this information in the target person's profile and can use it to decide whether they want to associate with that person in the future. This means that when you have received positive feedback, it'll guarantee better success with offers and requests in the future. Thus, it's good to always remember to give feedback on events, and also remind the other party to give feedback to you. Currently, you can give feedback in the web version of Sharetribe.\n\nFeedback in Sharetribe consists of a numeric evaluation and a textual description. The numeric evaluation can be between 1 (worse than expected) and 5 (much better than expected). If you give non-neutral feedback you need to tell what went especially well or wrong in the textual description.\n\nOn the profile page you can view following information about the user whose profile your viewing: the average of all the numeric evaluations, the amounts of different feedback ratings and a list of all feedback with textual descriptions. The facial expression of the Kaapo figure in each feedback describes the numeric evaluation associated to that feedback.";

You earn badges from actions like adding new offers and requests, commenting on others' content, from all types of resource exchange that takes place (selling and borrowing items, doing favors, organizing car pooling and so on) and just generally being an active user of the service. Note that you only get badges from those exchanges where you have received positive feedback.\n\nYou can view the badges the people have earned in their profile page. A person with lots of badges is most likely active, reliable and liked by other users. So be active in Sharetribe: buy, sell, lend and borrow items, do others favors, share rides and watch your badge arsenal grow!";
